# Task-8
Step 1: Choosing a VPN:
I chose Proton VPN, a reputable free VPN service that offers good privacy and doesn’t log user activity.

Step 2: Installation:
I went to Proton VPN’s official website, downloaded the Windows app, and installed it just like any other software.

Step 3: Connecting:
After logging into the app, I connected to the fastest available free server—usually the closest one to my location.

Step 4: Verifying IP Change:
I opened a browser and visited whatismyipaddress.com.
The IP address shown was different from my original one, meaning the VPN worked.

Step 5: Checking Traffic Encryption:
I browsed a secure website (one with HTTPS). Since the VPN was active and the site was encrypted, my traffic was protected.

Step 6: Disconnecting and Comparing:
I turned off the VPN in the Proton app. Then, I revisited websites and noticed that the browsing speed was a bit faster without the VPN.

Step 7: Researching VPN Privacy:
I learned that VPNs use encryption to hide your internet traffic, protect you on public Wi-Fi, and help bypass censorship or geo-blocks. However, free VPNs may have server or speed limitations.

Benefits:
1)Hides your real IP address
2)Encrypts your traffic
3)Protects your privacy online

Limitations:
1)Can slow down your internet speed
2)Fewer server options on free plans
3)You must trust the VPN provider not to log or misuse your data
